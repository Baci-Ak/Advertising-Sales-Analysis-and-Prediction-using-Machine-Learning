## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising budgets using various machine learning algorithms. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), building predictive models, evaluating their performance, and providing insights for optimizing advertising strategies.

## Business Context and Problem
In today's competitive market, businesses need effective strategies to maximize their sales by efficiently allocating advertising budgets across different media channels. This project aims to address this challenge by developing predictive models that can help the company make informed decisions about where to invest their advertising resources.

## Datasets
The project utilizes a dataset containing advertising budgets and corresponding sales figures across different media channels (TV, radio, newspaper) in various markets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the relationships between sales and advertising budgets, visualize trends, and uncover insights about the dataset.

## Machine Learning Model Building
The project builds and evaluates several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor.

## Model Evaluation
The models' performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared (R2), and cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.

## Results and Insights
The project provides insights into the importance of each advertising medium in predicting sales. Model coefficients, feature importances, and correlations are analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided for optimizing advertising budgets. Strategies to allocate resources effectively to maximize sales are suggested.
